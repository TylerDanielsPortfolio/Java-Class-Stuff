Pennies for pay. java Algorithm

This Program will demonstrate the use of a loop to calculate payment of pennies per days worked.
Import java.util.Scanner
Declare variables and constants
int daysWorked = 0;
double PENNIES = 0.01;
Create while loop for input validations
do{
Ask user for number of days worked
} while (daysWorked <=1);
Display table
System.out.println ("Total days & Total pay")
System.out.println("--------------------------");
Apply for loop
for(int numOfDays = 1, numOfDays <= daysWorked; numOfDays ++)
Display total of Pennies for days worked
Sysout println ("\n Total Pay" + "\t " + (PENNIES  -0.01));
